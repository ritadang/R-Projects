## Data Analysis Using Multiple Linear Regression

As an online marketplace for homestays, Airbnb has many listings of real estate in Westwood, Los Angeles. For the visitors to Westwood and potential Airbnb hosts, understanding the characteristics that affect the price of Airbnb stays could be important in making their decisions and planning their expenses or profits. Consequently, this study focused on finding out â€‹what factors of the properties could and how they could significantly contribute to the differences in prices for a one-night Airbnb homestay in the neighborhood of Westwood.

Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) was used to model the relationship between price and the selected features based on the public dataset collected by Inside Airbnb and directly sourced from the Airbnb website. After performing analysis preparation, model transformation, and variable selection, we obtained a final model that predicted price based on four significant independent variables: the total number of listings under the host, the number of bedrooms, whether or not the host has been verified through ID, and the type of the room. This finding is meaningful for residents and visitors in their planning of business or trips, and thus might have important implications for Airbnb operations at Westwood.
